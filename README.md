**Disclaimer:** The scripts provided in this repository are not designed to work "as is" due to the intentional exclusion of specific data such as authentication details (e.g., app registrations, client secrets). These details have been stripped for security reasons. In practice, authentication data should be managed and retrieved from a variable vault. Additionally, the scripts may be tailored to specific lab environments and might require customization for use in different contexts.
